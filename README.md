# PropertyWebBuilder

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/etewiah/property_web_builder.svg?branch=master)](https://api.travis-ci.org/etewiah/property_web_builder)

This project has been created to address a glaring gap in the rails ecosystem: the lack of an open source project for real estate websites.  

The result is that WordPress has become the dominant tool for creating real estate websites.  This is far from ideal and PropertyWebBuilder seeks to address this.
